# Intro
Our goal in this endeavor was to build a refined, statistically sound, and easy-to-use dashboard for the Maryland public.

We consider the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) official dashboard difficult to use and focused on the wrong indicators. It is far more important, for example, to examine the change in new cases than the number of cumulative cases; additionally, MDH doesn’t adjust any of its data for population, which is crucial in a state as diverse as Maryland.

Our dashboard focuses on the correct indicators, standardized where necessary, to accurately relay the current landscape.

# Construction
The dashboard was composed using the JavaScript library D3.js. This offered us the flexibility that we needed in order to design a tool that would effectively adapt to changing data. We made use of the live code website Observable to create the elements for the dashboard. Using Observable notebooks, we were easily able to embed the maps and charts that we created into our HTML.

The data was gathered from ____ and manipulated using R. 

# Elements
## Maps
### Change in cases maps
The most notable difference between our dashboard and the MDH official dashboard is the inclusion of a change in cases map. We are now months into the pandemic and little information can be gathered from total case counts. Notable outbreaks have occurred in recent weeks such as an outbreak at a crab packaging plant in Dorchester county and a steep increase in cases in the Baltimore area. Our map would clearly show outbreaks of this nature, while a total cases map does not offer sufficient information.

~~Communicating this information well is especially important in combating the spread of the virus, as it is absolutely critical that residents are aware of the locations of outbreaks so that they are able to avoid them.~~

To account for variation in daily case counts, our map compares the 7-day average in cases from today’s date with the average from 14 days prior. We then display a color based on the magnitude of the difference.

The map’s scale is divergent, meaning that it displays two colors. Red represents an increase in cases and blue represents a decrease. The darker the color, the larger the difference.

### Total cases maps
We have also included the total cases maps present in the MDH dashboard as well. While they do not offer a useful picture of the pandemic right now, they still provide useful context about the areas disproportionately affected over the course of the pandemic.

### Testing map
Similar to the MDH dashboard, we have included a map of tests administered. However, we have adjusted this map by population. We believe this metric is much more effective at quantifying the state's testing response.

## Topline numbers

## Line charts

### Hospitalizations

### Cases, deaths, positivity rate

## Bar charts

## Tables
We felt that it was important to allow the user to easily view the data for themselves.

### Cases and deaths

### Testing
